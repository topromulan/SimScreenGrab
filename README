Works like a charm. Assign it to a window button like [WINDOW KEY] + [P KEY] or something.

Any bakatmes welcome: For even more chancy screenshots, granularize the time index further than one second per.

And if there is any way for the user to communicate meaningful note to the shot, and get a pop-up without kicking flash out of Full Screen mode, that would rock.

What's up with that? I got understand X11R6 better to solve that, contributions encouraged but even more so fonts of information along these lines are encouraged!
